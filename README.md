# Bun htmx

Exploratory project, targeted mainly at making a POC project with htmx in a way
that is ergonomic and familiar for React developers

## Conclusion

This is a very nice experience, but Elysiajs is not yet stable enough for real
development. See this bug I found:
https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/issues/485

It's best to use expressjs or nestjs at this point, if you want to stay in the
JavaScript runtime ecosystem.

## Development

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
